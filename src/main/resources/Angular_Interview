1. Angular is a javascript binding framework which binds UI to model.MVVM framweowrk.Single page application using routers
2. AngulaJs uses javascript and contoller arictecture but Angular uses typescript and component architecture. Support for Ionic is there.
3. Directives helps to attach behaviuor to your html DOM.ngModel,hidden,{{}}
SAC(Structure-change structure of DOM (ngfor),Attribute(hidden),Component(<my-grid/>))
4. package.json - references of all javascript components,like pom has versions
5. Typescript adds types to javascript.It gives you OOP features.Write class,interface,extends with Typescript
6. CLI helps to create ready made project to kickstart with.npm install @angular/cli
ng new myapp
7. Binding code to bind view and model is called Components.Group of components is modules
8. Decorator says what type of class is it. @Component ,@NgModule means angular module
(You can create module by decorating it with annotation @NgModule)
9. Templates are html view in Angular.It can be html file or inline
  @Component({
    templateURL:
    template: inline
  })
 10. Data binding : Interpolation binding in html element,property binding [ngModel] ,event binding(click)="Toggle",2 way binding [(ngModel)] 
 11. Architecture of Angular
 12. SPA(Single page application) : load once and dont load it again and again. Angular routing.
 HomeRoutes = [
  path: 'Login' ,component: LoginComponent
  path: 'Home',component: HomeComponent
 ]
 In MasterPage.html,define router link and outlet
 <[routerLink]=["Home"]Home
 <[routerLink]=["Customer"]Customer

 <router-outlet></router-outlet>

 if you want to do from component use this.router.navigate["Home"]
 13. Lazy loading means on demand loading. Project needs to be divided into seperate modules like home,customers and then use loadChildren in HomeRoutes
 14. DI is the design pattern,common service,rather than creating an instance.In constructor we are asking to inject from outside.
 We do by adding the class in providers property in @Ngmodule
 @Ngmodule
 providers: [
  Token,
  AuthGuard,
  { provide: BaseLogger,useClass: HttpLogger}
 ]
 15. Difference between ngserve and ngbuild : ng serve builds in RAM,good for local testing. ng build() --prod does in drive in Prod.Compressed js file,minify
