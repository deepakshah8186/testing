3rd highest salary:
SELECT MIN(salary)
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT salary
      FROM Employee
      ORDER BY salary DESC
      LIMIT 3) AS TopSalaries;
The inner query selects the distinct salaries from
the Employee table, orders them in descending order (ORDER BY salary DESC), and limits the result to the top 3 salaries.

Here are the top 5 SQL query interview questions that are frequently asked, especially to test a candidate's knowledge of SQL fundamentals, querying, and problem-solving skills:

1. Find the Second Highest Salary
Question: Write a SQL query to find the second-highest salary from the Employee table.

sql
Copy code
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);
Follow-up: What if there are ties for the highest salary? How would you adapt this query?

2. Find Employees With the Same Salary
Question: Write a query to find all employees who have the same salary in the Employee table.

sql
Copy code
SELECT salary, COUNT(*)
FROM Employee
GROUP BY salary
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
Follow-up: Can you list all employees who share a salary, along with their details?

3. Get Department-wise Highest Salary
Question: Write a SQL query to get the highest salary for each department.

sql
Copy code
SELECT Department, MAX(Salary) as HighestSalary
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Department;
Follow-up: How would you list the employee names along with the highest salary per department?

4. Find Employees Who Don't Have Managers
Question: Write a query to find all employees who do not have managers (assuming there is a manager_id column where a NULL value indicates no manager).

sql
Copy code
SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName
FROM Employee
WHERE manager_id IS NULL;
Follow-up: What if you want to find employees who are not managing anyone (i.e., who are not listed as a manager by anyone)?

5. Join Multiple Tables (e.g., Employee and Department)
Question: Write a query to display employee details along with their department name, assuming you have two tables: Employee and Department where Employee has a dept_id as a foreign key.

sql
Copy code
SELECT e.EmployeeName, e.Salary, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
Follow-up: Can you modify the query to show all employees, including those who are not assigned to a department? (Hint: Use LEFT JOIN).
