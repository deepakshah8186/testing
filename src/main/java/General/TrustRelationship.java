// https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/
// In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
//
//If the town judge exists, then:
//
//The town judge trusts nobody.
//Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
//There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
//You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.
//
//Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.


// The below looks so tough
//class Solution {
//    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
//
//    }
//}

// check chat gpt what does  trustCount[trustee]++ mean
// trustCount[trustee]:
//
//trustCount is an array where each index represents a person.
//trustee is the index in the array representing a specific person who is being trusted.
//trustCount[trustee] accesses the current value at that index, which represents how many people trust this particular person (trustee).
//++ (Increment Operator):
//
//The ++ operator increases the value of the variable by 1.
//So, trustCount[trustee]++ will increase the count of people who trust the trustee by 1

// trustCount = [0, 0, 0, 0]  // Let's assume 4 people (0 to 3)
//Letâ€™s say trustee = 2, which means person 2 is being trusted. The expression trustCount[2]++ will:
//
//        Access trustCount[2] (which is currently 0).
//        Increment its value by 1, making it:
//        java
//        Copy code
//        trustCount[2] = 1
